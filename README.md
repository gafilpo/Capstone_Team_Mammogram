# Capstone Team Mammogram

## Introduction

The goal of our Capstone project was to explore different computer vision techniques for the classification of cancer in radiographic breast images of female subjects. The task was approached as a binary problem where the positive class is radiographic breast images with cancer and the negative class is the images without cancer. 
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle and consists of images from roughly 12000 patients with an averaging 4 images per patient. Since the data was part of a Kaggle competition, only [train_images] (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/data?select=train_images) was used and split into a train and test set.
